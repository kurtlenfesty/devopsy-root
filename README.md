# devopsy-root

This is the root repository for the Kurt Lenfesty Devopsy Coding Portfolio. This set of repositories tie together a demonstration of different technologies.

# Motivation

There are several motivations for writing this portfolio which is a collection of related projects:

## Demonstrate expertise in different technologies

I'm in the process of moving to a different role in a different organisation which entails demonstrating expertise in multiple technologies. A survey of the technologies described in job postings reveals over 50 technologies, including things like: Java, JavaScript, NodeJS, Python, Ruby, SQL (with MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres), MongoDB, MQ, Mule ESB, JSP, JPA, JTA, JMS, Hibernate, ibatis/myBatis, CloudFormation, AWS IAM, Docker, Terraform, SOA, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Jenkins, Spring Boot, Spring Web, Grafana, Swagger, React, Redux, Angular, Apache Camel, Amache AMQ, REST, XQuery, XPATH, XSLT.

That's a lot of technologies. From my point of view trying to do a technical interview with a subset of those technologies is almost impossible: what are you testing with your questions? How can you tell if you've excluded a skilled and desired candidate (a false negative) or included an unskilled or unwanted candidate (a false positive)?

The major sets of technologies that I want to demonstrate are:
- Competence in Java and Java-related technologies
- Competence in JavaScript and JavaScript-related technologies
- Competence in specific AWS services (kind of under the umbrella DevOps)

## Avoid the "just out of university" job interview

I've been to a few job interviews where the technical aspect of the interview is asking tricky questions about a specific technology (such as Java or JavaScript) or implementing some algorithm that is handled by a library. This could be certain aspects of the language or quirks. In my own experience as a software developer, most of my work is either debugging interactions with a framework or writing code to work within that framework. I think the tricky questions are best for those just out of school.

# Architecture

The purpose of these projects is to demonstrate some key technologies in Java, JavaScript, microservices, persistence, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) and cloud technologies. Each project is related to a specific architectural component or functional artifact or set of artifacts.

# Issues

Issues are tracked with a public Trello board (so you can see how issues are tracked). It can be viewed at (Kurt Lenfesty Portfolio)[https://trello.com/b/2dOLxwYu/kurt-lenfesty-portfolio-2018].

## Streams of work

### ARCH-xxx Architecture/design tasks

Any tasks related to architecture or design work. This can include diagrams and documentation.

### PIPE-xxx Pipeline tasks (CI/CD)

Any tasks related to Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).

### TOOLS-xxx Tools-related tasks

Any tasks related to tools and coding infrastructure, but not the actual running code. This would include things like gradle plugins, Nexus repositories.

### INFRA-xxx Cloud infrastructure tasks

Tasks related to setting up cloud infrastructure, including CloudFormation templates.

### UX-xxx Front-end tasks

Tasks related to building the front-end. UX is a bit of a misnomer in that the design is concerned with demonstrating technical interactions, not necessarily the best human interactions. This includes front-end tests.

### API-xxx API tasks

Tasks related to the API structure itself, which can include work on AWS API Gateway and developing a RESTFUL API. This includes API tests.

### SERV-xxx Back-end or services tasks

Tasks related to back-end services, including database structures. This includes back-end tests.
